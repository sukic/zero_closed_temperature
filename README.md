# zero_closed_temperature
Few analysis based on the weather stations data with the focus on days with the temerature slightly above zero.

## SRC data
The list of weather stations and the links to the data comes from the CHMI website:
https://www.chmi.cz/historicka-data/pocasi/denni-data/Denni-data-dle-z.-123-1998-Sb

The problem is, that either the list of station nor the datasets are not directly downloadable. Developer consol (F12) must be used to find the URLs and get the download links.
